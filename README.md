# Hi there, I’m Pooja Aryamane
I'm a Data Science Graudate student at NYU, under the Center of Data Science (CDS). 
My interests include applying computer vision models to Healthcare and contributing to the goal of making the models generalisable, dependable, and intelligent. 
I have worked with deep networks, out of distribution generalisation research problems, and boosting image segmentation capabilities of widely used networks.
